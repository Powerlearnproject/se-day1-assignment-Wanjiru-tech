#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the applying engineering principles,methods and tools so as to develop and maintain software systems. Its importance in the technology industry includes it enables the creation of software applications and systems and ensures that different sysytems work together seamlessly.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Structured Programming (1970s): Introduced modularity and control structures, improving code maintainability and laying the groundwork for modern programming practices.
Agile Manifesto (2001): Revolutionized software development with iterative, collaborative, and adaptive approaches, moving away from rigid, plan-driven methodologies.
DevOps (2010s): Bridged development and operations with automation and continuous delivery, enhancing the speed and efficiency of software development and deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phases of the software development life cycle include:-
i)Requirements gathering and analysis- involves gathering information about the software requirements from stakeholders, such as customers, end-users, and business analysts.
ii)Design- the software design is created, which includes the overall architecture of the software, data structures, and interfaces. It has two steps:
High-level design (HLD): It gives the architecture of software products.
Low-level design (LLD): It describes how each and every feature in the product should work and every component.
iii)Implementation or coding: The design is then implemented in code, usually in several iterations, and this phase is also called as Development.
iv)Testing- the software is thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works correctly.
v)Deployment- after testing, the software is deployed to a production environment and made available to end-users.
vi)Maintenance- this phase includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a more traditional approach to project management, involving a linear and subsequential approach. Each phase needs to be fully completed before moving on to the next phase.This approach offers predictability and clarity, particularly in stable environments such as regulatory compliance systems or construction projects, where detailed documentation and a structured process are crucial. However, its rigidity makes it difficult to accommodate changes once a phase is completed, and testing occurs later in the project, potentially leading to late discovery of issues.  In contrast, Agile embraces an iterative process which involves rapid actions and great flexibility. Projects are divided into small, manageable units, allowing for regular feedback and adaptation based on evolving requirements. Agile emphasizes working software and collaboration over comprehensive documentation, making it ideal for projects with dynamic requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Focuses on coding, developing, and troubleshooting the software. They are responsible for creating and maintaining the software product.
Quality assurance Engineer- Ensures the software meets quality standards through thorough testing and defect management. They focus on identifying and resolving issues to ensure the software is reliable and performs as expected.
Project Manager- Manages the overall project, including planning, coordinating, and communicating with stakeholders. They are responsible for ensuring the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all parties involved.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide a unified workspace for coding, debugging, and testing, integrating various tools and functionalities into a single application. This centralization streamlines the development process and reduces the need to switch between multiple tools.  IDEs also help developers write code more efficiently and with fewer errors. These features improve coding speed and accuracy, leading to higher productivity.Additionally, IDEs offer built-in tools for code refactoring, navigation, and version control integration, which help in maintaining code quality and organization.
VCS tracks changes to the source code over time, maintaining a history of modifications. This allows developers to review and revert to previous versions if necessary, which is crucial for managing and recovering from mistakes or issues. VCS acts as a backup system by storing multiple versions of the code. This capability ensures that developers can recover previous versions in case of data loss or unintended changes, providing a safety net for the development process. VCS also helps maintain code quality and consistency.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Managing Complex Codebases- as projects grow, the codebase can become complex and difficult to manage, leading to issues with understanding, maintaining, and modifying the code.This can be handled by breaking the codebase into smaller, manageable modules or components. This will simplify understanding and maintenance.
2. Dealing with Requirements Changes- frequent changes in requirements can lead to project delays, and rework. To counter this, engaging with stakeholders early to gather detailed requirements and use techniques like user stories and use cases.
3. Ensuring Software Quality- ensuring that the software is free of bugs and meets user expectations can be challenging, especially with complex systems.This can be done by implementing automated tests to catch bugs early and ensure ongoing code quality.
4. Managing Time and Deadlines- software engineers often face tight deadlines and pressure to deliver projects quickly, which can impact quality and lead to burnout.To curb this, the software engineeres may prioritize tasks, set milestones, and use tools like project management software to track progress.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Focuses on individual components, ensuring each unit of code functions correctly. It is used for catching bugs early and supporting code refactoring.This phase is important because it can be run every time a piece of code is changed, allowing issues to be resolved as quickly as possible. Itâ€™s quite common for software developers to perform unit tests before delivering software to testers for formal testing.
Integration Testing- Focuses on interactions between integrated components, ensuring that different parts of the system work together seamlessly. It helps identify issues in the integration points. It determines how efficiently the units are running together. 
System Testing- Focuses on the complete, integrated system, validating end-to-end functionality and performance. It ensures the software meets all requirements and works in a real-world environment.System testing is important because it verifies that the application meets the technical, functional, and business requirements that were set by the customer.
Acceptance Testing- Focuses on user requirements and readiness for release, ensuring that the software meets the business needs and is acceptable to end-users.Acceptance testing is important since when the program is more thoroughly tested, a greater number of bugs will be detected; this ultimately results in higher quality software

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating effective prompts that enable AI models to generate desired outputs responses based on given inputs. Prompt engineering essentially means writing prompts intelligently for text-based Artificial Intelligence tasks. Prompt engineering is important because it enhance communication between AI and humans, leads to getting more accurate responses and leads generation of incontext outputs.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear,
specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Finance bill 2024
Improved prompt- Highlight the newly introduced levies in the finance bill 2024
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear guidance on what information is needed(new levies), ensures the response is focused and relevant, and narrows down the topic to newly introduced levies in the Finance Bill 2024.
